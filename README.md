Credits on extracting the ASL from CDK go to the following repository:

https://github.com/nathanagez/aws-cdk-state-machine-asl

There is also an excellent blog post and recommended to read:

This repository takes a step further and creates the CDK within Jest and sends the ASL to Step Functions Local via the AWS SDK.

## How to run the test

```
# install the dependencies
npm install # whatsoever

# run the test(make sure you have docker installed)
npm test
```
